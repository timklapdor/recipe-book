description: This combination goes well with lamb and makes a cracking side to a good steak. For a complete, meat-free meal, it's brilliant with goat's cheese and crusty bread to mop it all up.

- 1 lemon, juiced and zested
- 1 tsp honey
- 1 tsp soy sauce
- 1 tbsp dijon mustard
- 3 tbsp olive oil
- salt and pepper
- 4 zucchini

1. For the dressing, put the lemon juice, half the zest, honey, soy sauce, mustard and oil into a small jar. Seal the lid, give it a quick shake, season and put aside until needed.
2. Using a mandolin or sharp knife, thinly slice the zucchini, then cut the snowpeas into thin strips and put the vegetables into a salad bowl.
3. Mix in the parmesan, nuts, herbs and dressing, season again and top with remaining lemon zest.
