1.  Preheat oven to 180°C. Spray a 7cm-deep, loaf pan with olive oil spray to grease.
2. Heat oil in a frying pan over medium-low heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring, for 5 minutes or until soft. Add the garlic and fennel seeds and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes or until aromatic. Transfer to a large bowl. Set aside to cool.
3. Add the mince, eggs, breadcrumbs, pistachios, rosemary and allspice to the onion mixture and stir until well combined. Season with salt and pepper.
4. Arrange the prosciutto, overlapping slightly, over the base and 2 long sides of the prepared pan, allowing the sides to overhang. Press the mince mixture into the pan. Fold the prosciutto over to enclose the filling. Cover with foil and bake for 20 minutes.
5. Remove the foil. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until the juices run clear when a skewer is inserted into the centre.
5. Cut into slices. Serve with relish and watercress.
