### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 120Â°C. Heat a large flameproof casserole dish over medium-high heat. Add speck and cook, turning, for 5 minutes or until crisp. Use a slotted spoon to transfer to a bowl. Add onions to the pan and cook, stirring, for 5 minutes or until browned. Transfer to the bowl.
2. Add half the butter and oil to the pan over high heat. Add mushrooms and cook, tossing, for 5 minutes or until brown. Transfer to the bowl.
3. Place flour in a large bowl and season with salt and pepper. Add chicken and toss to lightly coat. Add remaining butter and oil to the pan and add half the chicken. Cook, turning, for 5 minutes or until golden. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with remaining chicken.
4. Return chicken, speck, onions and mushrooms to the pan and pour over the wine. Add bay leaves and bouquet garni. Bring to a simmer. Remove from heat.
3. Bake, covered, for 1 hour or until chicken is tender and sauce thickens slightly.
4. Serve immediately with potatoes.
