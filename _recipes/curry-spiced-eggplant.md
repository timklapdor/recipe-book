Remove and drain on paper towel. Repeat with another 2 ½ tbs of oil and remaining eggplant. Remove from heat, season with salt to taste, then stir through coriander and set aside.
2. Heat remaining 1 tbs of oil in a large saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook curry leaves, cumin, mustard seeds, fenugreek, onion, garlic, ginger and chilli for 6-8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until onion is soft. Add the curry powder, tumeric and masala, stirring vigorously to combine. Cook for a further minute then add the eggplant and ½ cup water and stir to combine.
3. Cook over a medium-low heat for 8-10 minutes until eggplant is tender.
