1. Drain beans, rinse and drain again. Heat olive oil in a frying pan and cook onion for 10 minutes until soft. Add garlic, beans, cayenne, cumin, paprika, sugar, salt, pepper and water, and simmer over medium heat for 10 minutes or until most of the liquid has been absorbed.
2. Mash a few beans with a potato masher and stir through. Heat each flour tortilla in a dry frying pan on both sides until lightly golden.
3. Top each tortilla with a good ladleful of beans, a dollop of sour cream and two slices of avocado. Scatter the feta, jalapeno and coriander on top, drizzle with extra virgin olive oil (and chilli salsa if you like) and serve.

*NOTE: Can be made GF depending on the kind of torilla used.*
