ingredients:
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 50g unsalted buttered
- 1 x 1.5kg turkey breast fillet, skin on
- Sea salt
- Cracked black pepper
- 4 eschalots, peeled and halved
- 750ml chicken stock
- 10 sprigs of lemon Thyme
- 1 tbsp finely shredded lemon zest
- 1 tsp black peppercorns
- 50g unsalted butter
- 1/4 cup plain flour

1. Heat the oil and butter in a large heavy-based saucepan over medium heat.
2. Sprinkle the turkey with salt and pepper and add to the pan, skin-side down, with the eschalots. Cook the turkey for 5 minutes each side or until golden.
3. Add the stock, thyme, lemon rind and peppercorns and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low, cover with a tight-fitting lid and poach for 30 minutes or until the turkey is cooked through.
4. Remove the turkey from the poaching liquid, cover with aluminium foil and set aside to keep warm. Strain the poaching liquid into a heatproof jug, discarding the solids.
5. Melt the extra butter in a large saucepan over high heat until bubbling. Add the flour and cook, stirring, for 2â€“3 minutes or until golden. Gradually pour in the poaching liquid, stirring until smooth. Cook, stirring continuously, for a further 2 minutes or until the gravy has thickened.
6. Place the turkey on a serving platter. Slice and serve with the gravy
