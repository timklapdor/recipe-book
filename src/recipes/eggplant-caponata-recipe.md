1. Toss pine nuts until golden brown and nutty, about 15 minutes.
2. Heat 4 tablespoons oil over high heat and add eggplant, tossing occasionally, until completely softened and browned in spots (eggplant will initially absorb all of the oil then slowly release some of it), about 6 minutes.
3. Push eggplant to the side and add 2 more tablespoons oil to the center. Add spring onions, celery, capsicum, and garlic and toss to combine with the eggplant. Cook, stirring and tossing frequently, until vegetables are softened and aromatic, about 3 minutes longer.
4. Add reserved pine nuts, mint, parsley, tomato paste, ground cinnamon, raisins, capers, red wine vinegar, and balsamic vinegar and toss to combine. Drizzle in remaining olive oil and bring to a simmer, adding water a tablespoon at a time as necessary until caponata has a sauce-like consistency that is loose, but doesn't run freely over a plate. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
- With extra mint leaves and a drizzle of olive oil if desired. Serve with toasted bread or pasta.
