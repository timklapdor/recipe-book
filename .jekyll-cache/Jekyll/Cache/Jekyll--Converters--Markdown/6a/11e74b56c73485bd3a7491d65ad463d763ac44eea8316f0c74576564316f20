  <li>Add the oil to a heavy based saucepan and place over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until fragrant, about one minute. Add the spices, curry powder and leaves and stir constantly to prevent catching. Cook until there is a heady aroma then add the coconut milk and stock. Bring to the boil then add the chicken and immediately remove the pan from the heat. Cover with the lid and let stand for 30 to 40 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through. Depending on the size of the chicken thighs, start to check if the meat is cooked from about the 20 minute mark â€“ it should be just firm to the touch; if unsure, slice it to see inside.</li>
  <li>Remove the chicken from the saucepan, reserving the poaching liquid, and set aside. Return the poaching liquid to the saucepan and add the rice and lentils. Place over medium-low heat and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes or until the lentils are cooked through and the rice is soft. Check it regularly and add more chicken stock if required.</li>
  <li>While the rice and lentils are cooking, toss the salad ingredients together.</li>
  <li>To serve, scoop the rice and lentils into a large serving bowl, top with the chicken and cucumber salad then dollop over some yoghurt, chilli relish and a sprinkling of black sesame seeds.</li>
