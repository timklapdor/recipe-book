1.  Preheat oven to 180°C. Place the flour on a plate. Add the pork and toss to coat. Shake off excess. Season with salt and pepper.
2. Heat one-third of the oil in a flameproof casserole dish or large frying pan over medium heat. Add one-quarter of the pork. Cook for 2-3 minutes each side or until browned. Transfer to a large plate. Repeat, in 3 more batches, with remaining oil and pork, reheating the dish between batches.
3. Heat the butter in the dish until foaming. Add the leek and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes or until soft. Add the cider and cook until liquid has reduced by half.
4. Transfer the mixture to a casserole dish, if necessary. Add the pork, stock and tarragon. Cover and bake for 1 ½ hours or until the pork is tender. Add the beans and cream. Bake, uncovered, for a further 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
5. Serve with mash.
