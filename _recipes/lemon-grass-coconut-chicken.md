### Directions

1. Use a large heavy knife to cut 3 slashes in each chicken thigh. Place the chicken in a large glass or ceramic bowl.
2. Combine the lemon grass, turmeric, chilli flakes, ginger, garlic and shallot in the bowl of a food processor and process until a coarse puree forms. Add the coconut cream, fish sauce and tamarind and process until smooth.
3. Add the lemon grass mixture to the chicken and turn to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and place in the fridge for 3 hours or overnight to marinate.
4. Drain the chicken from the marinade. Heat a barbecue grill or large chargrill on medium-high. Brush with oil to lightly grease. Add the chicken, skin-side down. Season with salt and pepper. Cook on grill for 10-12 minutes each side or until the juices run clear when the thickest part of the chicken is pierced with a skewer.
5. Transfer to a serving platter and serve.
