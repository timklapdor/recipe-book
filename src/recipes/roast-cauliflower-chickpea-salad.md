1. Preheat oven to 200Â°C. Use a knife to trim the cauliflower stem. Place the cauliflower in a lightly greased baking dish. Add enough water to come 1.5cm up the side of the dish. Cover the dish tightly with foil. Bake for 1 hour or until the cauliflower is just tender.
2. Remove foil. Combine butter, cumin, coriander, paprika and cayenne pepper in a small bowl. Brush butter mixture evenly over the cauliflower. Bake, uncovered, for 20 mins or until lightly browned. Set aside for 5 mins to rest.
3. Meanwhile, combine the cranberries and lemon juice in a medium bowl. Set aside for 15 mins to soften. Stir in the onion, parsley and chickpeas.
4. Spoon the chickpea mixture around the cauliflower, stirring to combine with the juices in the dish. Cut the cauliflower into wedges to serve.
