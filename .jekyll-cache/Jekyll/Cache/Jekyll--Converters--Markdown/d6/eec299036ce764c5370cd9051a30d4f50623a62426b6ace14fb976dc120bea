  <li>Preheat oven to 150Â°C. Line a large baking tray with non-stick baking paper. Draw a 20cm disc on the paper and turn the paper ink-side down.</li>
  <li>Use an electric beater to beat the egg white in a clean, dry bowl until firm peaks form. Gradually add the sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating constantly, until the sugar dissolves and the mixture is thick and glossy. Beat in the cornflour, vinegar and vanilla essence.</li>
  <li>Spoon the meringue mixture onto the disc and use a flat-bladed knife to shape the meringue and make furrows. Bake in oven for 10 minutes.</li>
  <li>Reduce oven temperature to 110Â°C. Bake for a further 1 hour or until the meringue is crisp and dry. Turn oven off. Leave meringue in oven, with the door closed, to cool completely.</li>
  <li>Use a balloon whisk to whisk the cream in a bowl until firm peaks form. Spread the cream over the top of the pavlova. Top with mango and banana. Drizzle over passionfruit pulp.</li>
