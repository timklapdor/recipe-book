### What’s your story?

> The idea behind Kelpie was seeded at the at the AgriHack event hosted by Charles Sturt University in 2017. Ben and TIm formed a team and joined the Australian Wool Innovation stream of Tech eChallenge ran through Adelaide University. Our team came through and grabbed second place in the competition and it was at that point we knew we were onto something. We enrolled in the first cohort of startups in CSU’s AgriTech Incubator program and entered the eChallenge program to develop our idea and put some meat on the bones. Working with a range of experts and mentors Kelpie emerged and was pitched to a panel of experts in Adelaide. We took out second prize again at the rather glamorous gala dinner and awards ceremony - complete with novelty sized check!
