- 3½ cups vegetable or chicken stock/broth

1. Preheat oven to 180ºC.
1. Melt 20g butter in ovenproof pot (preferably with a lid) over medium high heat.
1. Add garlic and onion and cook until onion is translucent.
1. Add chopped sage and cook for 1 minute.
1. Add rice and stir so all the rice grains are coated with the butter and semi translucent.
1. Add white wine and cook until the the liquid evaporates - about 1 minute.
1. Add pumpkin and broth, stir. Let the liquid heat up but do not bring to simmer.
1. Put lid on (or cover tightly with foil) and place in oven for 25 minutes, until rice is just cooked (firm but not raw) - don't worry if there's excess liquid. If rice is still uncooked, return to oven for 5 minutes.
1. Add remaining butter and parmesan cheese.
1. Stir vigorously until the pumpkin turns into a puree and blends into the risotto. If it's too thick then add a splash of hot tap water. Should have a porridge like consistency so it sags a bit when served (see video), rather than staying in a tall, firm pile.
1. Spoon into serving bowls. Garnish with crispy sage, 1 or 2 teaspoons of brown butter and parmesan cheese. Devour immediately!

### Crispy Sage:
1. Melt butter in a small pan over medium high heat. Once foaming, add sage leaves and stir gently.
1. Cook for 1 1/2 minutes or until crispy.
1. Immediately remove sage onto paper towel lined plate and pour butter into a heat proof jug (butter should be brown by now).
