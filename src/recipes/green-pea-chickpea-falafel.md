*NOTE: May need to add breadcrumbs and egg to get recipe the right consistency*

1. If using fresh peas, add to a pot of salted boiling water, and cook for about 3 to 5 minutes, until tender. Drain the water and cool the peas completely.
2. Combine all ingredients (except the oil) in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until the mixture is well-combined, but not puréed. Adjust seasoning as necessary.
3. Heat about 1 inch of neutral oil in a skillet over medium heat, until it reaches 350°F.
4. Meanwhile, form the mixture into small patties. Prepare a paper towel-lined baking sheet and set aside. Fry the patties in batches, a couple at a time, without crowding the pan. Cook, turning occasionally, until golden-brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet to cool. Repeat with the remaining patties, and then serve immediately.

Serve with pita & tzatziki
