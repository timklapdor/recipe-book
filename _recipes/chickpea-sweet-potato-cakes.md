1. Cook the sweet potato in a saucepan of boiling water for 10 minutes or until tender. Drain. Return to the pan. Mash until smooth. Transfer to a bowl. Place in the fridge for 30 minutes to chill.
2. Mash the chickpeas in a bowl.
3. Add the chickpeas, onion, coriander, parmesan and flour to the sweet potato and combine. Season with pepper. Divide the mixture into 10 portions and shape each portion into a patty.

Bake in oven, turning once, for 30 minutes or until golden. Divide among serving plates. Serve with lettuce and chilli sauce
