### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 180°C. Rinse spinach in cold water. Place, with water clinging, in a microwave-safe dish. Cover and microwave on HIGH (100%) for 2 minutes or until wilted. Remove cover. Allow to cool for 5 minutes. Drain. Squeeze to remove excess water. Set spinach aside.
2. Combine cream, ricotta, egg yolks and 1 cup parmesan in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Stir until well combined.
3. Grease a 10-cup capacity, rectangular baking dish. Cover base with 1 layer pasta sheets, cutting to fit. Top with one-third of the ricotta mixture. Top with half the spinach and half the pumpkin. Repeat layers, finishing with remaining ricotta mixture. Cover with another layer pasta sheets. Top with mozzarella and remaining parmesan.
4. Bake, uncovered, for 50 minutes or until pumpkin is tender. Stand lasagne for 5 minutes. Slice and serve.
