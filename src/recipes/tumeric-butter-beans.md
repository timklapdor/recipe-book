ingredients:
- 100ml peanut oil
- 1 medium brown onion, finely sliced

- large pinch sea salt
- good pinch black pepper
- 1 tsp ground turmeric
- ¼ tsp ground coriander
- ¼ tsp sweet paprika
- 2 x 400g cans butter beans*

1. In a heavy-based pot gently warm the oil and add the sliced onion and garlic, salt and pepper. Cook the onion mix until golden. Add in the spices, turn down the heat and cook until fragrant and the oil has taken on a deep golden-red hue.
2. Add the beans and cover with the coconut milk (if using) and stock or water and bring to the boil. Allow to boil for several minutes then reduce to a simmer for about 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally to ensure the mixture doesn't catch, until tender. (If you're using dried butter beans, you will need to add more liquid and cook for a further 30 minutes or so.) At this stage you can decide how you wish to eat the beans: add more liquid to make them saucier or let the liquid evaporate. If you like, you could fold through some baby spinach or pan-fried kale (pictured) at the end, or add slices of pan-fried sausage.
3. Add condiments to taste and serve with cooked rice or toast. Whichever way you go, it's a great dish to have in the fridge, so don't be afraid to make a slightly bigger batch.

*Notes - You can also use 400g of dried beans soaked in cold water overnight. Add at step 2 with the water or stock but remember to salt at the end rather than the beginning. These can be vegetarian, vegan (avoid the fish and oyster sauces), or made with stock rather than coconut milk. The addition of chilli never hurts, either. You could add chilli flakes with the other spices or drizzle with sriracha or chilli oil at the end.*
