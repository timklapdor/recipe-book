### Directions

1. Heat oil in a cast iron pot over medium-high heat. Cook onion, carrot, celery, zucchini and garlic, covered and stirring occasionally until softened.
2. Add mince and cook, breaking up with a wooden spoon, for 6 to 8 minutes or until browned.
3. Add Anchovies and Tomato paste until combined then add Pepper and Italian Seasoning. Then stir in the can of tomatoes and the Red Wine. Once combined, add the Mushrooms to soak up any excess liquid, then reduce the heat to low. Add the Passatta and simmer, uncovered, 30 to 40 minutes stirring occasionally. Cook until thick so that when you stir there is no separation of solids and liquid.
4. Once the sauce is done, cook the pasta in a large saucepan of boiling, salted water, following packet directions, until tender. Drain.
5. Divide pasta among serving bowls. Spoon over sauce. Serve topped with cheese.
