  <li>In a food processor, blitz all the ingredients (except the chicken) to a fine paste, then smear over the chicken pieces. Cover and marinate overnight.</li>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 220 degrees fan-forced.</li>
  <li>Spread the chicken in a small roasting tray (or earthenware dish) skin-side up with all the paste and bring to room temperature. The chicken needs to be quite snug in the roasting pan so that it â€˜wet roastsâ€™ and does not dry out.</li>
  <li>Pour 500ml of water into the tray. Roast for 20 minutes, reduce the temperature to 160 degrees and cook for another one hour and 15 minutes.</li>
  <li>Serve with couscous, blanched greens and thick plain yoghurt.</li>
