### Ingredients

* 1 wheel of quality Camembert
* Olive oil spray
* Toasted sourdough, to serve
* Accompany with fresh fruit and nuts

### Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 180C.
2. Remove the cheese from its packaging. Cut a circle of baking paper 2cm larger in diameter than the cheese and place the wheel of camembert on it.
3. Using a sharp knife, score the top of the Camembert in a crisscross pattern. Bake for about 10-15 minutes or until the cheese is melting and the rind has started to caramelise.
4. Carefully remove cheese from the oven.
5. Serve with toasted sourdough, fruit and nuts.
