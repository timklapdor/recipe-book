1. Put all the BBQ Rub ingredients (dry mustard, onion powder, smoked paprika, garlic powder, ground cumin and ground pepper) in a small bowl and stir to combine.
2. Preheat oven to 175°C. Rub the tofu slabs all over with the remaining BBQ Rub. Apply a thin layer of oil (or use a non-stick spray) to condition the surface of the pan, when needed. Bake for about 25-30 minutes until slightly browned and flipping both sides halfway.
3. Toast your hamburger buns onto the griddle pan (at medium-high heat) with toasted sesame oil until slightly golden brown. Spread one of the buns with mayo. Add the BBQ tofu, greens and a bit of Sriracha. Add whatever filling you like! Serve and enjoy!
