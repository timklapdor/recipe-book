1. Heat the oil in a stockpot over medium-high heat. Add the lamb shanks and cook, turning, for 5 minutes or until brown. Transfer to a plate. Add the onion and garlic to the pan and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes or until soft. Add the cumin, ground coriander, cinnamon and turmeric and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds or until aromatic.
2. Return the lamb shanks to the pan with the stock and tomato. Bring to the boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, covered, for 1 hour. Uncover and cook, stirring, for 30 minutes or until the lamb is tender. Transfer the lamb shanks to a plate and cover with foil to keep warm. Increase heat to high and bring the stock mixture to the boil. Boil, uncovered, for 10-15 minutes or until the sauce thickens.
3. Meanwhile, to make the saffron rice, cook the pine nuts in a large frying pan over medium heat for 3-4 minutes or until toasted. Transfer to a heatproof bowl. Add the water to the pan and bring to the boil over high heat. Add saffron and reduce heat to low. Add the rice and cook, covered, for 12 minutes or until almost all the liquid is absorbed. Set aside, covered, for 10 minutes or until all the liquid is absorbed. Use a fork to separate the grains. Stir in the pine nuts and raisins.
4. Divide the saffron rice among serving plates. Top with lamb shanks and drizzle with sauce. Sprinkle with fresh coriander and serve with yoghurt.
