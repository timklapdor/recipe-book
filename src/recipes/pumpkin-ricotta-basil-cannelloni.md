1. Cook pumpkin in a medium saucepan of boiling water for 10 minutes or until tender. Drain. Return to pan. Mash until smooth. Transfer to a large bowl. Set aside to cool slightly.
2. Add ricotta, basil, pine nuts and parmesan to the pumpkin. Season with salt and pepper. Stir until well combined.
3. Preheat oven to 180°C. Spread 1 cup of the pasta sauce over the base of a square 20cm (base measurement) baking dish.
4. Place the pumpkin mixture into a piping bag fitted with a 2cm-wide plain nozzle. Pipe the pumpkin mixture into the cannelloni tubes. Place the cannelloni, in 2 layers, on top of the sauce. Pour over remaining pasta sauce. Top with the mozzarella.
