1. Heat the oven to 180ÂºC.
2. Remove the cheese from its packaging and remove and discard any plastic wrapping.
3. Put on a crumpled baking sheet and score the top of the rind in a crisscross pattern and push in a couple of cloves of garlic. Bake for about 10-15 minutes or until the cheese is melting and the rind has started to caramelise.
4. Cut a large cross through the top of the cheese, then peel back the rind. Scatter over chopped herbs and serve with pitta crisps or breadsticks for dunking.
