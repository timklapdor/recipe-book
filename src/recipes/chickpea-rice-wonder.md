- 1½ cups stock (I used chicken)
- 6-10 stems Tuscan kale (cavolo nero), trimmed and torn

1. Place a frypan over medium heat. Add the olive oil and once shimmering add the onion and cook until translucent. Add the spices and cook for 30 seconds or until fragrant and the onion is coated. Add the rice and chickpeas, stirring constantly.
2. Add the stock then reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes or until completely warmed through and most of the stock has absorbed.
3. Push the torn kale leaves into the frypan to soften with the heat of the stew. Add the lemon juice and zest and cook for another minute. Remove from heat and scatter over herbs and sultanas, if using. Dollop with yoghurt and serve.
