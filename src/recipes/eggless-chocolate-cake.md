1. Combine dry ingredients.
2. Combine wet ingredients and stir into flour mixture.
3. Pour mixture into a 20cm round tin and bake at 175-180C for 25-35 minutes (pan should be 1/3 to 1/2 full, to accommodate rising).
4. Stand for 10 minutes before turning out. Cake will be delicate while still hot.

>*Notes - Coffee can be used in place of water, and malt vinegar instead of white vinegar.
>The batter will be fairly thin, compared to ordinary cake batter.
> This recipe makes good cupcakes.*
