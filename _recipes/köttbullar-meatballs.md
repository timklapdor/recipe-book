#### Meatballs

1. Finely dice the onion and sauté gently in a little butter without browning.
2. Soak the breadcrumbs in milk.
3. Blend the ground meat, preferably in a food processor, with the onion, egg, milk/breadcrumb mixture and the spices to the proper consistency and taste. Add a little water if the mixture feels too firm.
4. Shape small meatballs with the aid of two spoons and place on water-rinsed plates. Brown a generous pat of butter in a frying pan, and when it “goes quiet” place the meatballs in the pan and let them brown on all sides. Shake the frying pan often.

#### Cream Sauce for Meatballs

1. Swirl the boiling water or beef stock in a pan.
2. Add cream and thicken with white flour if preferred.
3. Season with soy and pepper.
4. Serve the meatballs with the sauce, freshly boiled potatoes, and lingonberry jam.
