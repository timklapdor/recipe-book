1. Preheat oven to 180°C. Season the beef with salt and pepper. Heat half the oil in a flameproof casserole dish or large frying pan over medium-high heat. Add one-quarter of the beef and cook, turning occasionally, for 3-4 minutes or until browned. Transfer to a large plate. Repeat, in 3 more batches, with the remaining beef, reheating the pan between batches.
2. Add the remaining oil, bacon and onion to the dish. Cook, stirring, for 5 minutes or until golden. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute or until soft. Reduce heat to low. Add the flour and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Gradually add the wine, whisking until the mixture thickens.
3. Transfer the mixture to a casserole dish, if necessary. Add the beef, stock, tomato paste, orange rind, thyme and bay leaves. Cover and bake in oven for 2 ½ hours or until the beef is tender.
4. Meanwhile, heat the butter in a frying pan over medium heat until foaming. Add the combined mushroom and cook, stirring, for 5 minutes or until soft.
5. Add the mushroom mixture to the dish and bake, uncovered, for a further 15 minutes. Stir in the olives.
6. Divide the pasta among serving dishes and top with the beef mixture. Sprinkle with parsley. Serve with beans.
