1. Preheat the oven to 200Â°C
2. Place bacon in a large pan over medium-high heat. When the bacon starts to brown, add the onion and mushrooms. Cook and stir until everything is tender and browned.
3. Remove from heat and transfer to a medium bowl.
4. Use a wooden spoon to stir in the sun-dried tomatoes, cream cheese and spinach until well blended. Set aside.
5. Make a well in the loaf of bread by cutting an oval hole in the top, and pulling out the bread inside, leaving a shell. Spoon the cream cheese mixture into the bread. Place on a baking tray surrounded by the pulled out bread.
6. Bake for about 15 minutes in the preheated oven until the loaf is heated through.
7. To serve, place the loaf of bread with the dip onto the centre of a serving tray, and arrange the extra bread around it.
