  <li>For this rich Ragu, half the work is done before you start, thanks to the pork and fennel sausages, preferably bought from a good Italian butcher. Already cured and seasoned, they inject instant flavour into the braise. Serve this with any pasta â€” gnocchi or pappardelle are my favourites. This recipe can also be the base of a spectacular lasagne, as I discovered one desperate Sunday: add two extra tins of tomatoes and layer the ragu with pasta sheets and bechamel sauce.</li>
  <li>Remove skins from sausages and crumble meat. Heat a heavy-based pot over medium heat, then add sausage meat and pancetta. Fry until golden brown, stirring every few minutes. Donâ€™t worry if you get some sticky, crunchy bits â€” itâ€™s all flavour.</li>
  <li>Add onion, garlic, carrot, celery, bay leaves, dried chilli and fennel seeds. Stir well. The vegetables will sweat a little and ease the crusty, caramelised pieces from the bottom of the pot.</li>
  <li>Cook gently for 15 minutes, stirring every few minutes, until vegetables are soft and slightly caramelised. Add tomato paste and red wine and bring to a simmer. Add stock, tomatoes, rosemary and oregano, and continue to simmer for about 45 minutes on low heat, until the sauce has a thick, intense consistency. Cook pasta according to packet instructions.</li>
  <li>When cooked, season Ragu carefully (the sausages will already be salted), then add olive oil and cooked pasta. Bring pot to the table to serve.</li>
