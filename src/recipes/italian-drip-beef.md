1. Combine all ingredients in the slow cooker. Stir lightly to combine seasoning with the liquid.
2. Cover and cook for for 5 to 6 hours, or until meat is fork-tender and falling apart.
3. With two forks, completely shred all meat, leaving no large chunks behind. Serve immediately, or keep warm over a simmer on the stove. -You may make this the day before, then store in the refrigerator. Remove the hardened fat from the top before reheating.-
5. Serve on buttered, toasted rolls. Top with cheese and melt under the broiler if desired. Serve with juices from the pot.
