1. Heat your oven to 180°C fan-forced (200°C conventional).
2. Line a pan or tray with baking paper. Drain a can of chicky boiz and reserve the liquid. Give ’em a rinse, pat dry and chuck in a mixing bowl with 2 tablespoons olive oil along with a pinch of salt, a grind of pepper and the chilli flakes. Toss all that together and pour onto the baking tray. Put the tray in the oven for 15–20 minutes until crispy, then remove and let them cool right down.
3. Shred your cabbages and onion as fine as you like and put them into a large bowl. You can use a mandolin if you own one (no, not the small guitar) or a sharp knife. Grate the carrot and put it into the bowl; add your seeds and give it all a good toss.
4. Whiz up the mustard, aquafaba and vinegar, then slowly drizzle in the oil as you crank the blender up and down until it transforms the mixture into a mayo consistency. Finally, whiz in the lemon juice, and salt to taste.
5. Add ⅔ cup of that awesome “slauwce” to your veg bowl (the rest will keep in the fridge for a couple of weeks), put in your crispy chickpeas, along with a pinch of salt and a crack of pepper. Then mix it all together. Feel free to add more of the mayo if you like it a bit more sauce heavy, it’s your adventure, Zelda.
