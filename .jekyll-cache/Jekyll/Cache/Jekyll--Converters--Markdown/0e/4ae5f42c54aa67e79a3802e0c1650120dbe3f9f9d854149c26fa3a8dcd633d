  <li>Empty half the can of Beer and stuff Sage leaves or Rosemary into the cavity. Rub the Olive Oil over the bird with your hands to coat evenly, then season well, inside and out, with plenty of salt and pepper. Sprinkle on your favourite spice blend for some extra flavour.</li>
  <li>Hold the beer can upright on the bench, then impale the chicken with it, so the tinny is standing upright, and the chicken is sticking up in the air, legs facing down.</li>
  <li>Roast in an 180°C oven for 45-60 minutes. Check by inserting a knife in the joint between the leg and breast to make sure it’s no longer pink. Rest a few minutes, take great care removing the beer can (it may still have boiling beer in it), chop the chicken into pieces and serve with Potatoes and Roasted Vegetables.</li>
