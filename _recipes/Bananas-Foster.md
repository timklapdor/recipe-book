1. Slice the bananas and set them aside.
2. Heat a frypan over medium heat and add the butter and light brown sugar. Stir until ingredients are incorporated and simmering.
3. Add the bananas and spread them evenly. Simmer them for a few minutes and gently stir them to insure they are cooked evenly. The bananas will start to become slightly translucent during this process. The goal is to have soft bananas but not baby food.
4. Lower the heat and pour the liquor into a measuring cup. Add vanilla extract to the measuring cup then add to the skillet. Turn the heat off and gently stir.
5. Serve with the vanilla ice-cream.
