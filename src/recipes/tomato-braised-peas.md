1. In a medium saucepan, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil, then add the garlic and chilli, frying for 1 minute until aromatic. Add the diced tomatoes, season with about ¼ teaspoon of salt and a few turns of black pepper. Cover and cook on low heat for about 6-8 minutes, until the tomato mixture is thick.
2. Add the coconut milk, and season again with sea salt. Cover and cook for another 2-3 minutes to allow the flavours to meld. Add the frozen peas and cook, uncovered, for 5 minutes or so, until the peas are soft and everything is heated through (avoid cooking the peas for too long as you want to retain the greenness). Remove from the heat and serve immediately with rice.

*NOTE — If your budget allows, you could break a few eggs into the peas to cook as you would baked eggs.*
