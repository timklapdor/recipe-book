1. Place the feta, creme fraiche and garlic in a blender or food processor and whiz until chunky.
2. Add the lemon juice (start with 1 tablespoon, then add more to taste), olive oil and water and blend until smooth and whippy. If it's too thick, add a touch more water.
3. Season with a few good turns of black pepper and a touch of salt, if needed

#### Tips
- You can use the lemony whipped feta on its own as a dip at parties â€“ just add flatbread!
- Pine nuts add a Middle Eastern touch, but almonds will also add good crunch.
- Serve with charred or baked cauliflower to make it into a meal*
