1. Place peas and edamame in a large heatproof bowl. Add enough boiling water to cover. Set aside for 5 minutes. Drain well. Return to the bowl and use a stick mixer to blitz until coarsely chopped. Stir in the ricotta, sesame seeds, couscous, egg and chives. Season. Divide into 4 portions. Shape each into a patty.
2. Heat a non-stick frying pan over medium heat. Spray with oil. Cook the patties for 3-4 minutes each side or until golden.
3. Meanwhile, for the avo dressing, place the avocado, lemon rind, coconut cream, garlic and mint in a food processor. Process until smooth. Stir in 1-2 tbs lemon juice, to taste. Season.
4. Place the roll bases on serving plates. Top with the salad leaves, ricotta and pea patties, and grated beetroot. Add a dollop of the avo dressing and cover with the tops of the rolls.

*NOTE: Try replacing the edamame with podded broad beans, or use 1 1/2 cups of whatever frozen peas or beans you have on hand. You could also swap the ricotta for feta, or the couscous for breadcrumbs.*
