### Directions

1. Heat half the oil in a large, saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook beef, in batches, for 2 to 3 minutes or until browned. Transfer to a bowl.
2. Reduce heat to medium. Add the remaining oil to pan. Add onion. Cook, stirring, for 5 minutes, or until onion has softened. Add garlic and curry paste. Cook, stirring, for 1 minute, or until fragrant. Add coconut milk, coconut cream, stock, tamarind, fish sauce, sugar, cinnamon sticks and bay leaves. Bring to the boil. Return beef. Reduce heat to low. Simmer, partially covered, for 1 hour or until beef is just tender.
3. Preheat the oven to 180°C. Place rice in a 6cm-deep, 3.8 litre-capacity baking dish. Add potato to beef mixture. Stir to combine. Carefully spoon beef mixture over rice. Cover tightly with foil. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until beef, potato and rice are tender. Stand for 10 minutes.
4. Remove and discard cinnamon sticks and bay leaves. Sprinkle with peanuts and onion. Serve.
