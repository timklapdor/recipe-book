1. Cook the rice following directions. Set aside to cool.
2. Meanwhile, combine the oil, lemon juice and sugar in a small jug. Season with salt and pepper.
3. Combine the rice, chickpeas, tomato, cucumber, avocado, capsicum and pecans in a large bowl.
4. Mix the Olive Oil, Lemon juice and Caster Sugar for the dressing and gently toss until just combined. Divide among serving dishes. Serve with the bread.
5. Try serving this recipe as a side salad at your next barbecue - it works well with chargrilled chicken breasts and barbecued beef steaks.
