### Directions

1.  In a food processor, blitz all the ingredients (except the chicken) to a fine paste, then smear over the chicken pieces. Cover and marinate overnight.
2. Preheat the oven to 220 degrees fan-forced.
3. Spread the chicken in a small roasting tray (or earthenware dish) skin-side up with all the paste and bring to room temperature. The chicken needs to be quite snug in the roasting pan so that it 'wet roasts' and does not dry out.
4. Pour 500ml of water into the tray. Roast for 20 minutes, reduce the temperature to 160 degrees and cook for another one hour and 15 minutes.
5. Serve with couscous, blanched greens and thick plain yoghurt.
